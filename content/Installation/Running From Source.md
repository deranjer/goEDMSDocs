### Running from Source

#### Requirements

* Go version 1.13
* Tesseract binary
* Imagemagick binary
  
#### Optional Installs

To work on/edit the frontend you need the following:  

* Node
* yarn
* parcel

Once you have the backend requirements, edit the `serverConfig.toml` with the bin paths to tesseract and imagemagick.  In the root of the project run `go get` to download all the dependencies (ensure go.mod exists) and then start the server with `go run main.go`.  This will run the backend server, which, by default, serve the "built" frontend (located in "public/built").  

However, if you want to run a "live" version of the frontend you need to enter the "public" folder, then run `yarn install`. This should install every package you need from `yarn.lock`.  

Then you can run `parcel run index.html` and parcel will server up the source of the React App, which you can access on (by default) :1234. To connect your live frontend to the backend you need to edit `frontend-config.js` with the apiURL to your backend.  If you make changes to the frontend and want to have the backend serve it, run `parcel build index.html` and then copy the files into the "built" directory (although delete frontend-config.*.js since that is dynamically generated by the backend).
